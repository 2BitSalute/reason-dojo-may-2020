## Creating a Group DM on Discord 

Group DMs on Discord will be used to communicate with you and your group during the Dojo. To create a Group DM, you'll need the following:
- A Discord account ([sign up to create one](https://discordapp.com/register))
- The Discord app ([download here](https://discordapp.com/download))
- Be friends with the people who will join your group (follow [this guide](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/218344397-How-do-I-add-my-friend-to-my-friends-list-) to add someone)

Now that you have that, you can create a group. Follow these steps:
1. Inside the Discord app, navigate to the Home page (click the Discord icon in the left sidebar)
