## Event Details

Below, you'll find all the information about the event itself.

### Description

Reason Dojo is a unique take on meetups. In the beginning, we'll walk you through installing Reason and setting up your IDE. After that, we'll present you with an app & requirements. We'll split everyone up into groups. Each group will have at least one experienced Reason developer. 

Your goal: build the app as a group during the allotted hacking time.

The least experienced developer will drive (i.e. write code) while the others help guide. The purpose of this is both to:
1. take the pressure off the new person (they follow the guidance of others)
2. let the others mentor and guide as they help architect the app

If you've never been done a dojo-style meetup before, it's the perfect opportunity to:
- learn + improve your Reason skills 
- help others by working as a team (with both new + experienced Reason devs)
- build something fun that you can take home

### Location (virtual)

This particular event is happening online using a combination of Zoom and Discord. The main sessions (Introduction, Demos, and Closing) will take place on Zoom and be recorded. The Hacking Session will take place on Discord. We encourage you to use Group DMs to coordinate with your team members over voice or video chat.

We will also have places to socialize during the event on both Discord and Zoom.

## Resources

Below, you'll find helpful resources for both before, during and after the event:

### Prepping for the event

Don't worry if you've never written a line of Reason before! We'll cover installing Reason and setting up your IDE during the introduction of the event. Make sure you have [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/download) installed and bring a positive mental attitude to the event! 

### Creating a Group DM on Discord 

Group DMs on Discord will be used to communicate with you and your group during the Dojo. To create a Group DM, you'll need the following:
- A Discord account ([sign up to create one](https://discordapp.com/register))
- The Discord app ([download here](https://discordapp.com/download))
- Be friends with the people who will join your group (follow [this guide](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/218344397-How-do-I-add-my-friend-to-my-friends-list-) to add someone)

Now that you have that, you can create a group. Follow these steps:
1. Inside the Discord app, navigate to the Home page (click the Discord icon in the left sidebar)
