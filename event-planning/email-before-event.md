# Emailing Participants Before Event

It's a good idea to email participants before the event. We sent this 12 hours before the event started. Here's an example:

## Example Email

Hi all,

Thanks for registering for Reason Dojo happening Friday, May 1st(today/tomorrow depending on where you are) at 3pm PT (view in your timezone https://bit.ly/3cv61yr).

We wanted to share some information with you before the event.
Event Details

You can find a schedule + a lot of helpful information here in this repo we've set up for the event.

ðŸ”—Link to repo: https://github.com/ReasonDojo/reason-dojo-may-2020

You'll want to make sure you're a member of the [Reason Discord](https://discord.com/invite/reasonml) and have Zoom installed. More details under "[Prepping for the event](https://github.com/ReasonDojo/reason-dojo-may-2020#prepping-for-the-event)."

Feel free to respond to this email or ping me on Discord for any questions: jsjoeio#7954
IDE Setup

If you're new to Reason, we recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) + [reason-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode). This will provide the best experience and be the easiest for others to help you troubleshoot should you run into issues.


We also recommend installing [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) since we'll be working in groups remotely. This is an extension that works well for pair/mob-programming and will allow you and your group to work within the same editor.
Test Reason Locally

Lastly, we recommend testing things locally to make sure your local environment is properly set up for Reason development.

We recommend following the [ReasonReact installation guide](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/installation). This will guide you through setting up a basic app to make sure thing are working.


We'll post the Zoom link in the #reason-dojo channel on Discord tomorrow at the start of the event. Looking forward to seeing you online!


With gratitude,

Joe and Sean
